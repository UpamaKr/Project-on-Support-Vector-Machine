Data:The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set
The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset:

Iris-setosa (n=50) <br>
Iris-versicolor (n=50)
Iris-virginica (n=50)

The four features of the Iris dataset:

sepal length in cm
sepal width in cm
petal length in cm
petal width in cm

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Originally used as an example data set on which Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was applied, it became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines
